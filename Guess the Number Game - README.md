Guess the Number Game - README

Instructions:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Open a text editor and copy the C++ code from `guess_the_number.cpp`.
3. Save the file with the extension `.cpp`, for example, `guess_the_number.cpp`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved `guess_the_number.cpp`.
5. Compile the code using your C++ compiler. For example, if you are using g++, you can compile it with the following command:
   g++ guess_the_number.cpp -o guess_the_number
6. Once the compilation is successful, you will have an executable file (guess_the_number.exe on Windows or guess_the_number on Linux/macOS).
7. Run the game by typing the name of the executable and pressing Enter.
8. The game will prompt you to guess a randomly generated number between a given range.
9. Enter your guess, and the game will tell you whether the actual number is higher or lower.
10. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the secret number.
11. The game will congratulate you and terminate once you guess the number correctly.

Have fun playing the game!
